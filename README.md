## Summary
Calendars for Sports is a project that allows people to be able to share and customize NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL team calendars to your liking.  
For example, let's say you are from Tampa Bay and love all Tampa teams (NHL: TB Lightning, NBA: Orlando Magic, NFL: TB Buccaneers, MLB: TB Rays),  
our app makes it really easy to view and make these changes and also allows you to export this to your favorite google calendar to get alerts!
